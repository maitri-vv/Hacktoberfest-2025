## 🚀 How to Contribute

We welcome contributions of all sizes, from fixing a typo to adding a whole new feature section. Here’s how you can get started:

### **Step 1: Find an Issue or Propose a Feature**

* Look for open issues in the **[Issues tab](https://github.com/rakesh-dev-07/Hacktoberfest-2025/issues)**. If you find one you'd like to work on, please comment on it to let us know.
* If you have a new idea for a feature (e.g., a "Testimonials" section, a "FAQ" section, a new animation), please **[create a new issue](https://github.com/rakesh-dev-07/Hacktoberfest-2025/issues/new)** to discuss it first.

### **Step 2: Fork & Clone the Repository**

1. Click the "Fork" button at the top-right of this page.
2. Clone your forked repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/modern-landing-page.git
   cd modern-landing-page
   ```

### **Step 3: Create a New Branch**

Create a new branch for your feature. This keeps your changes separate from the main project.

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

*(Example: `git checkout -b feature/add-testimonials-section`)*

### **Step 4: Add Your Feature**

Now it's time to code!

1. **HTML:** Add the HTML for your new section in `index.html`. Place it in a logical order.

2. **CSS:**

   * Create a new CSS file for your feature inside the `css/components/` directory (e.g., `css/components/testimonials.css`).
   * Add your styles to this new file.
   * Import your new CSS file at the bottom of the `css/style.css` file:

     ```css
     @import url("./components/testimonials.css");
     ```

3. **JavaScript:** If your feature requires interactivity, add your JavaScript code to the `js/script.js` file. Please comment on your code to explain what it does.

4. **Assets:** If you have images, add them to the `assets/images/` folder.

### **Step 5: Commit and Push Your Changes**

Once you're happy with your changes, commit them with a descriptive message and push them to your forked repository.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Add Testimonials section"
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### **Step 6: Create a Pull Request**

* Go to your forked repository on GitHub and click **"Contribute" > "Open pull request"**.
* Provide a clear title and a detailed description of the changes you've made.
* Include screenshots or GIFs if your changes are visual.
* Link the issue your PR is solving by writing `Closes #issue-number` in the description.
